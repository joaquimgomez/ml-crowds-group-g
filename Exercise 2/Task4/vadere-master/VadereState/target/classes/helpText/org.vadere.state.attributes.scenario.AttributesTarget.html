<h1> AttributesTarget</h1>

<p>
Attributes of a target area, used by TargetController in VadereSimulation.

</p>

<hr>
<h2> Field: waitingTimeYellowPhase</h2>
<p>
Waiting time on the target in the yellow phase (before red and green).
This can be used to cycle traffic lights in red, green or yellow phase, so that (Y -> R -> Y
-> G) cycles.
Needed on crossings, otherwise cars bump into each other.
</p>

<hr>
<h2> Field: waitingTime</h2>
<p>
Waiting time in seconds on this area.
If "individualWaiting" is true, then each element waits the given time on this area before
"absorbing" takes place.
If it is false, then the element waits this exact time before switching in "no waiting" mode
and back. This way, a traffic light can be simulated.
</p>

<hr>
<h2> Field: startingWithRedLight</h2>
<p>
If set to false, starts with green phase (nonblocking), otherwise blocks the path (red
phase).
</p>

<hr>
<h2> Field: shape</h2>
<p>
Shape and position.
</p>

<hr>
<h2> Field: parallelWaiters</h2>
<p>
Number of elements that can wait or be absorbed at one time in parallel on this area.
If zero, an infinite amount can wait or be absorbed.
</p>

<hr>
<h2> Field: absorbing</h2>
<p>
True: elements are removed from the simulation after entering.
False: the target id is removed from the target id list, but the element remains.
</p>

<hr>
<h2> Field: id</h2>
<p>---</p>

<hr>
<h2> Field: deletionDistance</h2>
<p>---</p>

<hr>
<h2> Field: nextSpeed</h2>
<p>
If non-negative, determines the desired speed the particle (pedestrian, car) is assigned
after passing this target.
Can be used to model street networks with differing maximal speeds on roads.
</p>

<hr>
<h2> Field: individualWaiting</h2>
<p>
True: each element on the target area is treated individually.
False: the target waits for "waitingTime" and then enters "no waiting mode" for the same time
(and then goes back to waiting mode). See "waitingTime".
