<h1> Attributes</h1>

<p>
Abstract base class for all static simulation attributes.

Implementations must provide a no-arg default contstructor (either implicitly
or explicitly) to enable deserialization from JSON.

Attributes are "static" parameters i.e. they are immutable while a simulation
is running. This is implemented by deriving from the
<a href='/helpText/org.apache.commons.attributes.Sealable.html' class='class_link'>org.apache.commons.attributes.Sealable</a> interface. Attributes can have
setters, but the setters must call the {@code checkSealed()} method before
changing a value! In addition, if an attributes class contains other
attributes classes as fields, it must override <span class='local_link'>seal()</span> to also seal
these objects. All other fields must be immutable (e.g. String, Double,
VPoint,...).

The standard clone method makes a flat copy. This is enough if the subclass
only triangleContains immutable fields. If the subclass triangleContains other Attributes
objects, it must implement a copy constructor and override <span class='local_link'>clone()</span>
to make a deep copy.
