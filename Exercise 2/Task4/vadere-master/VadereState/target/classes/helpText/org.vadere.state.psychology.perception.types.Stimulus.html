<h1> Stimulus</h1>

<p>
The base class of all available stimuli.

A stimulus has a time and possibly additional information.

The additional information depend on the type of the stimulus and should be
added by subclasses. For instance, a stimulus "ElapsedTime" can provide
the current time. A stimulus "Threat" can have a loudness and a polygon
which describes where the threat can be perceived.

This class and its subclasses should be de-/serialized as JSON. Therefore,
provide some annotations so that serialized objects do not reveal Java
type information like "util.ArrayList".

See @link http://www.baeldung.com/jackson-inheritance

Watch out: subclasses require a default constructor so that
de-/serialization works!
