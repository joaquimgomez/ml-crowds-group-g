<h1> GradientProviderType</h1>

<p>
Holds all viable gradient provider types.

</p>

<hr>
<h2> Field: PEDESTRIAN_CYCLE_CONTINUOUS</h2>
<p>
obstacle "forces", continuous
</p>

<hr>
<h2> Field: PEDESTRIAN_CONTINUOUS</h2>
<p>
uses PEDESTRIAN_CONTINUOUS, but enables the
user to define two teleporter lines where the pedestrians are set back to
the respective other line.
</p>

<hr>
<h2> Field: FLOOR_EUCLIDEAN_CONTINUOUS</h2>
<p>
using discrete solution of the Eikonal equation,
like with Fast Marching
</p>

<hr>
<h2> Field: FLOOR_EUCLIDEAN_CONTINUOUS_MOLLIFIED</h2>
<p>
using continuous solution with Euklidean
distance to targets
</p>

<hr>
<h2> Field: FLOOR_EIKONAL_DISCRETE</h2>
<p>---</p>

<hr>
<h2> Field: OBSTACLE_CONTINUOUS</h2>
<p>
using continuous solution with
Euklidean distance to targets, mollified so that the gradient is
continuous
