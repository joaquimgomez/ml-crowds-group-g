<h1> SelfCategory</h1>

<p>
According to the self-categorization theory ("reicher-2010"), people define
themselves as a member of social categories. People can have multiple
categories, e.g., father, football fan, colleague. At a specific point in
time, only one category is salient.

Our agents use these categorizations to derive a specific behavior:
<ul>
<li>
TARGET_ORIENTED agents try to reach the target as quickly as possible.
</li>
<li>
E.g., if an agents is "COOPERATIVE" (category), the pedestrian swaps places
(behavior) with other "COOPERATIVE" pedestrians (only if both feel committed
to this category as in-group member, see {@Å‚ink GroupMembership}.
</li>
<li>
THREATENED agents maximize the distance to a threat.
</li>
</ul>
Usually, the self category of an agent changes during a simulation.
