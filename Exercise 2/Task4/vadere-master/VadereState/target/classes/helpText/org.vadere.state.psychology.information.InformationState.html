<h1> InformationState</h1>

<p>

A person can receive multiple forms of information.
In the default setting, we assume that each agents have global knowledge about the location to target.
If the psychology layer is used, the information is set up as a stimulus.
If the crowd is managed e.g. over TraCI, information can be passed as directly to an agent or as stimuli.
If the reaction behavior is modelled, it is also possible that agents refuse to react to information.
