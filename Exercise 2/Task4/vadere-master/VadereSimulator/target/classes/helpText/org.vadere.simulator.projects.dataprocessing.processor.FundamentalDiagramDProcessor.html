<h1> FundamentalDiagramDProcessor</h1>

<p>
<p>This processor computes the fundamental diagram by computing at a certain time the
<tt>density</tt> and the <tt>velocity</tt> defined by the Voronoi-diagram where the points
are the pedestrian positions. The density is equal to the sum of areas of all Voronoi-cells
intersecting the <tt>measurementArea</tt> divided by the area of the <tt>measurementArea</tt>.
The velocity of a pedestrian is defined by its velocity times the area of its Voronoi-cell.
Therefore the <tt>velocity</tt> is the sum of all those pedestrian velocities of Voronoi-cells
intersecting the <tt>measurementArea</tt> divided by the <tt>measurementArea</tt>.</p>
