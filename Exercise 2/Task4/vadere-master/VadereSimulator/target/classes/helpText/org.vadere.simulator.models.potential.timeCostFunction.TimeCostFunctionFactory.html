<h1> TimeCostFunctionFactory</h1>

<p>
The TimeCostFunctionFactory creates the TimeCostFunctions with the currently
availible configurations. The Decorator-Pattern is used for the
TimeCostFunctions. So you can combine different TimeCostFunctions!

UNIT: static potential field, with F=1

NAVIGATION: time cost funtions which takes the density, measured by the
gaussian function, in count. The higher the density the higher is the
repulsion effect. The obstacle and the pedestrian density influences this
chraracteristics.

QUEUING: time cost funtions which takes the density, measured by the gaussian
function, in count. The higher the pedestrian density the higher is the
gravity. The obstacle density still has an repulsion effect.
