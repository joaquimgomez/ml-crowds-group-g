<h1> PedestrianRepulsionStrategy</h1>

<p>
Agents are repelled by other agents by increasing the potentials of neighboring agents.
Therefore, the parameters of the respective potential functions
need to be adjusted depending on the required social distance.
The underlying formulas can be found in the article Mayr, Koester: Social distancing with the Optimal Steps Model
We implement the realistic use case only.
