<h1> CooperativeCognitionModel</h1>

<p>
The <a href='/helpText/rel_/CooperativeCognitionModel.html' class='class_link'>CooperativeCognitionModel</a> makes a pedestrian cooperative if its
average speed falls below a certain threshold. I.e., usually the agent
could not move for some time steps. For example, in case of other
counter-flowing agents.

<a href='/helpText/rel_/SelfCategory#COOPERATIVE.html' class='class_link'>SelfCategory#COOPERATIVE</a> should motivate pedestrians to swap places
instead of blindly walking to a target and colliding with other pedestrians.
