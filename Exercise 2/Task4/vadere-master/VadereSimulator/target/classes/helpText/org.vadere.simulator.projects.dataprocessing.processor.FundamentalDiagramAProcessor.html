<h1> FundamentalDiagramAProcessor</h1>

<p>
<p>This processor computes the fundamental diagram by computing an (average) <tt>flow, density</tt> and
<tt>velocity</tt> over a certain time (<tt>deltaTime</tt>). This is done by counting the number of pedestrians crossing
a line for some <tt>deltaTime</tt>. If P is the set of pedestrians crossing in that duration
(<tt>deltaTime</tt>) the <tt>flow</tt> is defined by: the size of P divided by (te - ts) where
ts is the time the first pedestrian crossed the line and te is the time the last pedestrian crossed
the line i.e. (te - ts) is smaller or equals <tt>deltaTime</tt>. The <tt>velocity</tt> of a pedestrian
crossing the line is its velocity the time-step time in which the crossing happens. So it is not
exactly the crossing time (plus, minis simTimeStep). The <tt>density</tt> is defined by:
<tt>flow</tt> divided by (<tt>velocity</tt> times the length of the crossing line). Therefore, the
crossing line has to be defined appropriately. In addition the processor writes out <tt>deltaTime</tt>,
and the <tt>measurementTime</tt>. The first <tt>measurementTime</tt> is equal to <tt>deltaTime</tt> divided
by 2, the second is <tt>deltaTime</tt> plus <tt>deltaTime</tt> divided by 2 and so on.</p>
