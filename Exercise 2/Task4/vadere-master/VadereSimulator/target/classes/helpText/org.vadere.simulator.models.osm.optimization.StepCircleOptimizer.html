<h1> StepCircleOptimizer</h1>

<p>
Abstract Base Class for StepCircleOptimizer.

The abstract functions need to be implemented by every StepCircleOptimizer.
The additional functions only serve to compute a true solution (obtained via computationally expensive brute force).
This allows to compute a metric that measures the quality of the respective concrete subclass of StepCircleOptimizer.

Currently, only the StepCircleOptimizerNelderMead uses the metric functionality. To compute the brute force
solution only the "computeAndAddBruteForceSolutionMetric" function has to be called (NOTE: depending on the setting
in "getReachablePositions" this can be very expensive.
