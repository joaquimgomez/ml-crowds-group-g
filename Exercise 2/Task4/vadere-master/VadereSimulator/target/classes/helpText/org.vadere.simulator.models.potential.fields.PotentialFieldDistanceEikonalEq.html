PotentialFieldDistanceEikonalEq computes the nearest distnace to any obstacle by computing
the distance at certain discrete points lying on an Cartesian grid. Values inbetween are
bilinear interpolated. To compute the distance at these grid points the eikonal equation is
used by choosing obstacles to be the destination area of the propageting wave front.
