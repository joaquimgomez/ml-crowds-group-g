<h1> AerosolCloudDataProcessor</h1>

<p>
<p>This processor writes out the shape and the pathogen load of all <a href='/helpText/org.vadere.state.scenario.AerosolCloud.html' class='class_link'>AerosolCloud</a>s.
Each row corresponds to one aerosol cloud at a given simulation time. The shape of an
aerosol cloud is described by the radius and its center ([x, y]-coordinates).
</p>

<p>To reduce the size of the output file, one can reduce the sample frequency, that is
the processor writes out only every {@param sampleEveryNthSimStep}.
