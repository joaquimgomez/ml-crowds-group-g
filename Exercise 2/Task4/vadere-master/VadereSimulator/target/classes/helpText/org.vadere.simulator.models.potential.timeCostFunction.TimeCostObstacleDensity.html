<h1> TimeCostObstacleDensity</h1>

<p>
TimeCostObstacleDensity is a time cost function for the obstacle density that
uses image processing filters. The measurement with a loading is done by the
ObstacleGaussianFilter that uses the javaCV library. This has to be done only
once, because the obstacles don't move.

<hr>
<h2> Field: loading</h2>
<p>
the loading of the obstacle density (= c_o).
</p>

<hr>
<h2> Field: logger</h2>
<p>
only for logging.
</p>

<hr>
<h2> Field: obstacleImageFilter</h2>
<p>
the image filter for the measurement of the density by calculating the
integral over the obstacle area by using the convolution.
