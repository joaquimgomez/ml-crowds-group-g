<h1> GroupSpawnArray</h1>

<p>
<h1>Groups</h1>

Groups are spawn as a rectangle (axb) with the smallest possible deviation of a and b.  The
groupNumber is zero-based index counting possible spawn point for a group (see below). The spawn
positions (groupNumbers) will overlap. Depending on the selected Attributes the algorithm will
test in advance if the groupNumber is free (not occupied).

(0)    (1)    (2)    (3)    (4)    (5)    (6)    (7)    (8)   <-- groupNumber-------------- |
**00 | 0**0 | 00** | 0000 | 0000 | 0000 | 0000 | 0000 | 0000 |----------------------------- |
**00 | 0**0 | 00** | **00 | 0**0 | 00** | 0000 | 0000 | 0000 |----------------------------- |

<h2><span class='local_link'>getNextGroup(int, List)</span>  (without Random Object)</h2>
Iterate through the groupNumbers in order (0-->8) but remember the last used groupNumber for each
groupSize in the HashMap nextGroupPos. The Iteration order is generated with lambada expressions.
Also getNextGroup allows overlapping spawning a complete overlap is not allowed due to numerical
problems in OE-Solvers which would loop forever.

<h2><span class='local_link'>getNextGroup(int, Random, List)</span> (with Random Object)</h2>
Same as before with the distinction that the groupNumbers as iterated in a random order. This
function will update the the HashMap nextGroupPos but this is not a problem because in this case
the nextGroupPos is not used.

<h2><span class='local_link'>getNextFreeGroup(int, List)</span> (without Random Object)</h2>
This function will always iterate in order order (0-->8) and will use the first free groupNumber
available. This function ignores  the nextGroupPos HashMap.

<h2><span class='local_link'>getNextFreeGroup(int, Random, List)</span> (with Random Object)</h2>
same as above but it will use a Randomize groupNumber Iterator.
