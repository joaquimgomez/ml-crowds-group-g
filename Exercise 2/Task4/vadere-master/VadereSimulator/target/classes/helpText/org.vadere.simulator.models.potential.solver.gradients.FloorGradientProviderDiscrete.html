<h1> FloorGradientProviderDiscrete</h1>

<p>
Provides a floor gradient given the geometry of a scenario. This class uses
the Fast Marching algorithm (Sethian 1999) to compute a solution to
G(x)||grad T(x)|| = 1, the Eikonal equation. G(x) must not be equal to one,
like in FloorGradientProviderContinuous, however, the solution of
FloorGradientProviderDiscrete is only present on a discrete grid. CAREFUL:
this destroys (= resets to 1) the convergence rates of many higher order
integrators if mollification of the gradient is done improperly!
