<h1> PedestrianVelocityProcessor</h1>

<p>
This processor computes the velocity based on pedestrian positions and the simulation time.
Let p be the position of a pedestrian at the current time step s. And let q be the position
of the same pedestrian at the time step s minus <tt>backSteps</tt> then the velocity
of this pedestrian at the time of time step s is defined by:
the length of the vector q-p divided by the duration between s and (s minus <tt>backSteps</tt>).
