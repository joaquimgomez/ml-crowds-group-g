<h1> PedestrianEvacuationTimeProcessor</h1>

<p>
Problems with this class:

- evacuation time is saved on every update (inefficient)
- only works if agents are deleted at their targets

A more better way could be implemented using target listener. In this case it
is important to check that the target is the agent's final (last) target.
