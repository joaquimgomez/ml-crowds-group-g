<h1> PedestrianMaxDegreeOfExposureProcessor</h1>

<p>
Log the degree of exposure when a pedestrian reaches its final target. If a pedestrian does not reach the target
before the simulation ends, log current degree of exposure (i.e., we enter the post loop and the topography still
holds pedestrians).

Use a simple map with pedestrian.getId() as key and update the value in each simulation step.
This is a naive and inefficient approach, but it works.
