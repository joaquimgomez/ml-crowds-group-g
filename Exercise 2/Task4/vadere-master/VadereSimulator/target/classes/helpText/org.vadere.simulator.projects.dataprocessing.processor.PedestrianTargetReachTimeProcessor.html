<h1> PedestrianTargetReachTimeProcessor</h1>

<p>
Log the time when a pedestrian reaches its final target. If a pedestrian does not reach the target
before the simulation ends, log Double.POSITIVE_INFINITY (i.e., we enter the post loop and the
topography still holds pedestrians).

Use a simple map with pedestrian.getId() as key and update the value in each simulation step.
This is a naive and inefficient approach, but it works.
