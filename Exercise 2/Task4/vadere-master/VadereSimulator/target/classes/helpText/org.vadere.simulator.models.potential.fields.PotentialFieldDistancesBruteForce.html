PotentialFieldDistanceEikonalEq computes the nearest distnace to any obstacle by computing
the distance at certain discrete points lying on an Cartesian grid. Values inbetween are
bilinear interpolated. To compute the distance at these grid points the the exact distances
to all obstacles are computed choosing the minimum.

Note: This can be computational expensive if there are many and or complex obstacles.
