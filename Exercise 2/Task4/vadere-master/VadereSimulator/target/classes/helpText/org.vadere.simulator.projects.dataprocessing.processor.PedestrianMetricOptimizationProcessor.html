<h1> PedestrianMetricOptimizationProcessor</h1>

<p>

This processor requires the true and found solution (both point and function value).
The solution are stored in OptimizationMetric and have to be set in StepCircleOptimizer.

Note: currently only the Nelder Mead and PedestrianOSM support this feature, but it should be easy to generalize
this to other optimizer or more general pedestrian.
