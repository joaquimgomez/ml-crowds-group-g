<h1> PedestrianLoadingStrategyPotentialDifference</h1>

<p>
The PedestrianLoadingStrategyPotentialDifference calculates an individual
laoding for each body of the floor based on target potential differences. The
central idea is to calculate the potential difference on a potential field
the body doesnt use. The value is a measure of the repulsion effect of this
body with respect to all pedestrians that uses the potential field that uses
this laoding strategy. A negative potential difference indicates that the
body does not move towards the target, so the laoding should be higher. If
the potential difference is zero the body does not move. The Problem is that
a negative potential difference on the static potential field does not
necesserely mean that the pedestrian disturbs. On the dynamic field on the
other hand we have no well defined measurement. So we try to combine the
informations. The dynamic field gives the indication that the movement is
disturbing (if the potential difference is negative on the dynamic field) or
is not disturbing (if the potential is positive). The static field gives the
us the measurement.
