<h1> ParadeLengthProcessor</h1>

<p>
@author Marion Goedel
Evaluates the length of a parade, based on the PedestrianPotentialProcessor.
The length of the parade is given in travel time by calculating the difference in the potential.
The difference in potential is calculated between the average of the first numberOfAgentsAveraged agents and the
average of the last numberOfAgentsAveraged agents.
The parade length is only evaluated for the timesteps in which all agents are spawned.
That means, it will not work with continuous spawning.
