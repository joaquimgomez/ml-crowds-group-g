<h1> BonnMotionTrajectoryProcessor</h1>

<p>
This processor creates trace files based on the output of BonnMotion. BonnMotion is a mobility
scenario generation and analysis tool developed by the Communication Systems group at University
of Bonn et. al. (https://sys.cs.uos.de/bonnmotion/index.shtml)

This format is used by the omnet++ to add pre-recorded mobility data to a network simulation.
https://doc.omnetpp.org/inet/api-current/neddoc/inet.mobility.single.BonnMotionMobility.html

The trace is based on a node-by-line waypoints. Thus each line represents  one pedestrian and
each waypoint consist of 3-Tupel (2D) or 4-Tupel (3D) encoding (time X-Coord Y-Coord Z-Coord)

This Processor only supports 2D waypoints.
