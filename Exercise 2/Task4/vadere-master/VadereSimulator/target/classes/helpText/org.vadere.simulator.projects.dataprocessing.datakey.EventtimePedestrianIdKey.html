<h1> EventtimePedestrianIdKey</h1>

<p>
This key consists of the pedestrian id and the event time ("eventTime") which is the *exact* time at which an
event occured (which can be any positive real value). In between simulation time steps (see parameter
"simTimeStepLength" (currently default at 0.4) there can be multiple events. The event time therefore allows to
have more (accurate) data (all the events in between simulation time steps).
