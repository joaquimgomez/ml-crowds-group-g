<h1> InformationFilter</h1>

<p>
The <a href='/helpText/org.vadere.simulator.control.external.models.InformationFilter.html' class='class_link'>InformationFilter</a> The InformationFilter is used if information is only available to a limited extent.

Possible restrictions are that
Information is only available in a certain area (e.g. only within sight of a sign),
information is only available at a certain time (dynamic light signal),
the same information is only perceived once (recurring information is filtered by an app or human perception).
only the first arriving information is perceived (new and contradictory information is filtered by an app or basically rejected by humans)
