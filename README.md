#  Master's Practical Course - Machine Learning in Crowd Modelling and Simulation

This repository contains the work done by Angelos Kafounis, Caner Karaoglu and Joaquin Gomez Sanchez in the Master's Practical Course Machine Learning in Crowd Modelling and Simulation.
The course consists of 5 exercises:

- Ex1 - Modeling of Crowds
- Ex2 - Simulation Software
- Ex3 - Dynamical systems and bifurcation theory
- Ex4 - Representation of data (Principal Component Analysis, Diffusion Maps, Neural Networks)
- Ex5 - Learnign Dynamical Systems

and a final project where we analyzed and tried to reproduce the results of the paper "Prediction of Pedestrian Speed with Artificial Neural Networks" by Tordeux et al.
All the results can be found in the papers/reports in the reports folder.
